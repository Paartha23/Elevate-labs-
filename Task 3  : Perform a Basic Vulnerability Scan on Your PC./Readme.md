# Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Scan

## Overview
This repository contains the results and documentation of a vulnerability scan performed using **Nessus Essentials**. The scan was done to identify potential security issues in a target system and understand their risks.

## Objective
The main goals of this scan were to:  
- Detect vulnerabilities in the system.  
- Determine the severity of these vulnerabilities.  
- Suggest ways to fix or reduce these risks.

## Tools Used
- **Nessus Essentials** – A free version of Nessus for learning and small-scale scanning.  
- **Target System** – The system or network that was scanned.

## Scan Summary
The scan report includes:  
- Vulnerabilities categorized by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low.  
- Descriptions of each vulnerability.  
- Recommended steps to fix or reduce risks.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Simple Fixes
Here are some typical vulnerabilities found in Nessus scans and simple ways to mitigate them:

| Vulnerability | Description | Simple Fix / Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
