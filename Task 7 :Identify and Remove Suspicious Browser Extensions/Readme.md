##  Research – How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

During my review, I researched how browser extensions—especially unverified or malicious ones—can negatively impact users. I learned that harmful extensions can:

- **Steal sensitive information:** Some extensions can access browsing data, saved passwords, or wallet information (e.g., phishing attempts through fake MetaMask clones).
- **Inject unwanted ads or trackers:** Malicious add-ons may insert ads, pop-ups, or scripts into web pages to generate revenue or track user activity.
- **Modify browser behavior:** They can alter search results, redirect traffic, or slow down system performance.
- **Collect personal data:** Many suspicious extensions secretly log browsing history and send it to third parties for data mining or targeted advertising.
- **Bypass permissions:** Some extensions request unnecessary permissions (like access to all websites or clipboard data), which can be exploited for malicious purposes.

I found several real-world cases of fake extensions pretending to be useful tools but instead performing hidden data collection. This emphasizes the importance of verifying an extension’s **developer, permissions, and user reviews** before installation.

##  Documentation – Steps Taken and Extensions Removed

After analyzing my browser’s installed extensions, I performed the following actions:

### **Extensions Reviewed**
- MetaMask  
- Power Thesaurus  
- Grammarly  
- Dark Reader  
- Google Translate

### **Actions Taken**
1. Verified the source and permissions of each extension.
2. Cross-checked reviews and update frequency from the Chrome Web Store.
3. Identified that **Power Thesaurus** and **Google Translate** were rarely used and had broad permissions that weren’t necessary.
4. **Removed** both extensions to minimize potential security risks.
5. Kept **MetaMask**, **Grammarly**, and **Dark Reader** after verifying they were from trusted publishers and actively maintained.
6. Restarted the browser and noticed improved startup time and responsiveness.

### **Observation**
- Browser performance improved slightly (faster tab switching and loading times).  
- No unwanted ads or redirects appeared after cleanup.  
- Learned how easy it is for malicious extensions to blend in with legitimate ones.

✅ **Conclusion:**  
Regularly auditing browser extensions helps maintain both **security** and **performance**. Only trusted and necessary extensions should remain installed to reduce exposure to malicious activity.
